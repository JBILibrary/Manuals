# Welcome Team Members
Creating Audio Publications for the JBI Library is a collaborative process.  Many lasting friendships have been formed at JBI over the years.  Your team members include a member of the JBI Staff, a Director and a Narrator.
## Staff Supervisor
Our technical staff will train and assist you in getting started, including the necessary adjustments of all audio equipment for ptimum sound quality.  They will always be available to answer questions and to aid with specific pronunciation problems.
## Volunteering at JBI
Our dedicated vokunteers are the heart of our organization.  You need no professional experience to be a JBI Volunteer.  You will be trained to work in our state-of-the-art studios to create quality recordings of magazines, newspapers and books.
## As a Volunteer Director, you will:<!-- "dir" (image of clapboard) -->
Work with a Narrator to create an excellent audio book by:
* Monitoring the level and quality of the recording;
* Documenting and ensuring correction of inadvertent errors or accidental omissions made by the volunteer Narrator;
* Maintaining a recording session log sheet (see example on <a href="page-15">page 15</a>).
## As a Volunteer Narrator, you will:<!-- "nar" (image of microphone on desk-stand) -->
* Review and prepare your book or magazine before the scheduled session; 
* Take direction from your Volunteer Director.

# Overview
## Orientation Session
During an initial small group meeting you will receive an overview of JBI International's mission and library services.  You will also recieve information about the Volunteer Program, including evaluation, training and testing.
## Evaluation
The evaluation will consist of the prospective volunteer's review of a pre-recorded studio session.  This will allow studio staff to determine whether the trainee has the necessary level opf active listening skills to succeed in the training process.
## Training
Each trainee will be evaluated by one of our studio staff during an actual recording session.  Staff will evaluate the skill level of each trainee and will either promote the trainee to the Volunteer Program or suggest that more training may be needed.
## Scheduling Sessions
Once approved, you will be contacted by the Studio Manager to set up a schedule that works for you.  You will be assigned as either Director or Narrator.  Arriving early will give you a chance to meet your team members and to prepare together in our Volunteer Lounge (offering free coffee, tea and snacks).
## Quality Control
After you have been engaged in the process for a while, you may also be asked to Quality Control (QC) a completed project.  During this process, mistakes overlooked during recording are flagged, documented, and then re-recorded.  (see example on page 16).

# TRAINING
Your staff trainer will cover all o the topics below in greater detail.  There will be plenty of time for questions as you learn at your own pace.  You can refer to this manual during training and use it for reference once you're working in the studio.  Staff will be certain that the booth is stocked with pencils and post-its and will also provide water and/or tea.
## Prior to the Start of Recording<!-- "dir" "nar" -->
Once a project is assigned, JBI will provide the Narrator with the script in advance of the scheduled session.  Review and familiarize yourself with the text and note any uncertainties about pronunciation.  Research the words in question and discuss with the Director before recording begins.

Remove any bracelets, chains, or other jewelry that might create noise.  Some types of clothing such as heavily starched shirts and nylon jackets can also produce noise, especially when using <q>body language</q> (gestures with their arms and hands).  When working at JBI, please refrain from wearing any fragrances as some individuals may be sensitive or allergic to them.  All cell phones must be turned <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">off</span>!

Once the Narrator is comfortably seated in the booth, the Staff Supervisor will adjust the microphone placement for optimal sound quality.
## Microphone Placement<!-- "staff" (image of a person) "narr" -->
The microphone (used with the <q>pop filter</q> to minimize the sounds of <q>plosives</q>: B, P, F, Th, W) should be placed approximately one foot from the Narrator's mouth.  The Staff Supervisor will place the microphone so that it will not interfere with the Narrator's ability to read the text, or cast a shadow on the script.  The closer the mic is to the Narrator, the less <q>room</q> (including ventilation fan noise) will be evident.  To minimize mouth noises, microphones may be moved to the 11:00 or 1:00 position, rather than aimed straight at the Narrator's mouth.

---

<!-- Page 7 -->
## Adjusting the Headphones and Talk-Back Microphone<!-- "dir" "narr" -->
The Narrator begins reading the script in a normal conversational tone so that the Staff Supervisor can set an accurate recording level.  Once that is done, the Narrator can adjust his/her own headphone level.  If headphone volume is too low, Narrators sometimes tend to speak louder.  The opposite is also true - if headphone volume is too high, some Narrators might pull back from normal speaking volume.  Once Narrators can hear themselves comfortably, it's time to adjust the level of the talk-back microphone.

The talk-back <q>mic</q> allows for communication between the Director and Narrator.  It can be used in one of two ways: in the <q>puch to talk</q> mode, the talk back mic is active only when the button (bar switch) is depressed.  Or, the mic can be locked into the <q>on</q> position by depressing the bar switch and sliding it towards yourself.  Feel free to as yourt Staff Supervisor to demonstrate.  Directors, converse with your respective Narrators to establish communication and have them inform you when they hear your voice at a comfortable level.
## Mixing Board (as shown on <a href="#page-14">page 14</a>)<!-- "dir" -->
This is where the levels are set for listening only.  Adjustments made here will not affect the actual recording.  The Director has his/her own headphone volume control separate from the one that the Narrator uses, although the balance between Narrator's microphone, the talk-back microphone, and playback from the computer will be the same balance for all.  If the Narrator is having difficulty hearing the talk-back microphone, slowly turn up the <q>trim</q> (knob above the level knob) to increased talk-back volume.  Please do not adjust the <q>EQ</q> knobs, as they will affect the quality of what you are hearing but not of what is being recorded.

All adjustments should be made and tested before beginning the recording, so as to not break the flow of the session.  This should be done quickly and efficiently.  Don't wear out your Narrator with a lengthy rehearsal.  Make sure that the door to the recording booth is <u>completely closed</u> and sealed.  <u>Check this often!</u>

## Role of the Director<!-- "dir" -->
The Director provides guidance for accuracy as well as pacing, energy and intent.

Potential Problem Areas:
 * <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Articulation</span>
When in doubt, pause, go back and listen again, or re-record.  Make sure words are clear, accurate, and well articulated.
 * <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Pronunciation</span>
If you're unsure of a word's correct pronunciation, check an online web site with audio samples of the word, such as [www.m-w.com](www.m-w.com).  In most cases someone on our staff will have the correct pronunciation of Hebrew and Yiddish words (or other languages).
 * <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Pacing</span>
A nice natural mediaum pace should be maintained.  Point out politely if you feel that the Narrator is going too fast or to oslowly.
 * <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Sound Quality</span>
During the recording session, the Director must listen carefully at all times to detect any change in sound quality.  This might be due to the Narrator's drifting from the original position in realation to the microphone.  If so, ask the Narrator to return to the original position, or re-adjust the microphone position so that you can re-record from the point where you first noticed the difference in sound quality.
Changes in sound quality also include pops from the <q>plosives</q> (B, P, F, Th, W), excessive mouth noises and lip smacks, page turning or paper rustling, or noise created by jewelry or clothing.  If there are excessinve mouth noises, suggest that the Narrator hydrate his/her mouth (by drinking some water, warm tea, or eating a slice or two of green apple).  Problem stomach noises can be tamed by eating some bread or cookies.

Remember to take breaks.  Ask your Narrator to tell you when he or she needs to take a break.  Many times within the first hour the reader is just <q>getting on a roll</q> and moving along at a good pace.  If so, you don't want to interrupt that.  If, however, you begin to notice that the Narrator is making an increasing number of mistakes or that the energy level has dropped - that's a good time to politely suggest a break.  And while it may sound obvious, everyone should use the rest room before resuming the recording session.

## The Recording Software<!-- "dir" -->
LCM (<span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Low Complexity Mastering</span>) software was designed for the Library of Congress to provide an easy-to-use method for Talking-Book production at the LOC's network libraries.  Most of the equipment the volunteer sees on the desk in the studio will be adjusted for each session bt the Staff Supervisor.  The Staff Supervisor will find the correct files and open the program to che correct place to begin recording.

One of hte best ways to the well trained is by observing a qualified staff or experienced Director in action.  At least two one-hour sessions of observation should take place.  THese can be schedueld at your convenience.

During training on this software, you will learn about:
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Pick-Ups</span>
Inserts of omissions and replacements of mistakes, and other reasons for re-recording a section.
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Inserting Markers</span>
Points on the recording timeline to locate pick-ups or edits to be checked.
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Adjusting the Pre-Roll</span>
<q>Pre-roll</q> is the amount of the previous recording the Narrator hears prior to the new <q>pick up</q> point.  Try starting with 5 seconds and adjust as needed.  When a new recording (or insert for re-recording) is being made, the tally LED in the booth will switch to red, indicating that recording has begun.
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Adjusting Levels</span>
Levels and soudn quality of the new recording must match those of the previous recording, as there is little or no <q>post production</q> work done to many of these recordings.
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Viewing the Waveform</span>
The progress of recording is reflected in the creation of a waveform, a visual representation of the audio signal.  The waveform created by each person's voice is unique to that person.  At the conclusion of recording, the cursor (a vertical line) appears at the beginning of the waveform.  During playback, the cursor tracks along the waveform, moving left to right.  Double-clicking anywhere along the length of the waveform will place the cursor in that position to allow playing, editing or re-recording beginning at that point.

---

<!-- Page 10 -->
## Reading the Waveform<!-- "dir" -->
It is important to learn how to read waveforms so that the task of live editing is simplified.  You will learn to identify:
* an indrawn breath
* the initial <q>attack</q> of a word
* various word endings
* end of workd spacing versus end of sentence spacing
## Mastering the Computer Keyboard<!-- "dir" -->
Pre-set keyboard commands
* Start recording
* Stop recording
* Rewind (10 seconds of rewind per tap of key)
* Play (to review material already recorded)
* Insert tone for separation of chapters or articles
* Zoom in / Zoom out (to aid in accuracy during editing)
* Adding markers for the purpose of identifying mistakes and edit points
## Role of Narrator<!-- "narr" -->
The Narrator records the text with the aid of the Director.  Narrators will rely on the Director to listen for and point out:
* Mispronounced or flubbed words
* Changes in sound quality
* Changes in the Narrator's energy level or pacing

The Director is always listening from the perspective of the JBI Library user to make sure that the intent of the material is clearly conveyed.
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Keep it Fresh</span>
Your audience wants to beentertained and/or absorb information.  Use an appropriate energy level and maintain it.
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Pacing</span>
Try to maintain a comfortable pace.

---

<!-- Page 11 -->
* Identifying Narration Errors<!-- "dir" "nar" -->
The recording session <u>must</u> be interrupted to correct the following errors:
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Stumbling over Words</span>
Even partial stumbles, where the Narrator catches him/herself and recovers, must be re-recorded.
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Narrator Interruptions</span>
Coughs, throat clearing or stomach noises detected.  These may sound slight to you but they will be louder in the recording than you perceive.
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Incorrect Pronunciation</span>
Check if the name is available in the Library of Congress <q>Say How?</q> Directory (www.loc.gov/nls/other/sayhow.html).  If not, agreement must be reached among the Staff Supervisor, Director and Narrator on the pronunciation to be used.  This pronunciation must be noted in the Director's copy of the text for quality control purposes.
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Incorrect Emphasis</span>
If, while recording, a sentence doesn't seem to make sense or is confusing, the problem can be due to emphasis placed on the wrong words.  In this case, you should stop recording, rewin, replay, and listen again.  Discuss the emphasis and re-record if necessary.
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Transposition of words</span>
Inadvertently switched words in a sentence are not acceptable (even if it still makes sense).
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Mis-matched Energy and Pacing</span>
When making a pick-up recording, the Narrator should read along during the pre-roll, so as to match the energy and pacing of the previously recorded segment.
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Grammatical Errors in the Text</span>
These errors must not be ignored.  Rather, they must be corrected by the Director/Narrator team.  Errors in the material must be referred to the studio manager for a decision on how to proceed.
* <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Stray Noise</span>
It is also necessary to stop and re-record if any stay noises, such as knocks on the desk, lamp, or microphone, interrupt the session.

# <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Punch-in-Free Editing Process</span><!-- "dir" -->
In the current recording procedure, when a mistake occurs, the Director or Narrator stops the recording, and they discuss where to start re-recording.  The Director must find that spot on the waveform, place the blue line in the exact spot to ensure a proper edit, and then press <q>record</q>.  The Narrator hears the playback and then begins recording again.  This process, for anyone other than the most advanced Director and Narrator, is time consuming.  Although the Director may be a precision editor and place the blue line in the perfect spot, this does not ensure that the edit will be perfect.

An alternative to this procedure is as follows: When the Narrator makes a mistake, he/she pauses and says <q>pick-up</q>, the Director presses the <i>M</i> key (marker) on the keyboard, thereby producing an <q>error tag</q> on the screen at that particular time and the recording continues.

If the Director catches a mistake before the Narrator does, he/she simply tells the Narrator via the talk-back mic where to start re-reading.  The Narrator pauses, says <q>pick up</q> and starts again.  The Director presses the <i>M</i> key to flag that start of the new recording.  There is no time wasted making an edit.  The Narrator can maintain his/her <q>flow</q>, and the Director can keep focused on the material and the quality of the recording.

Following the completion of the session, the Director and Narrator play back and review the recording they just made.  They can look at the waveform in wide view and see all the error markers, and know where each mistake is in the recording.  To fix a mistake, the blue line is placed prior to the beginning of the sentence containing the error, highlighted through the fumbled sentence, including the phrase <q>pick-up</q> spoken by the Narrator, right through to the point right before the sentence is re-read.  The entire highlighted area is deleted and the mistake is gone.  Each edit will be checked, and the sentences will flow as if there had been no mistake.

This process not only makes the recording session go much faster, but it ensures that each edit is perfect, and allows the Director to focus on making sure the quality of the recording is error free.

---

<!-- Page 13 -->
# <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Standardized Script Marking</span><!-- "dir" -->
When a mistake occurs, place a bracket (seen in the sample marked scipt below) at the point in the script where the pickup recording starts, or at the actual edit point.  If there is more than one pick-up for the same mistake, this is noted by a number next to the bracket, signifying how many pick-ups were done in total until the final acceptable one.

Mouth noises are noted with an X in at the spot where the Director hears it.

Long pauses which need tightening are noted by 2 parallel vertical lines (||).

Words in question are circled and usually checked later at a break or at another pick-up point following the questionable word or phrase.
